## Hi, I‚Äôm Abdullah Bello.  
An aspiring **Cloud & Cybersecurity Engineer**  

Welcome to my corner of the internet!  
I‚Äôm currently diving deep into the **ALX AWS Cloud Fellowship**, gaining hands-on experience in designing **secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions**. With a background in **Computer Science**, I‚Äôm passionate about building resilient architectures and integrating **security from day one**.

This blog is my **digital brain dump**: lessons learned, architectural patterns, project breakdowns, and the occasional ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt this work?‚Äù moment, shared openly as I grow.
