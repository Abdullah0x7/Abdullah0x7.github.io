## Hello, I am Abdullah Bello.
**IT Instructor | Cloud Engineer | SecOps Specialist**

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I am a Cloud Engineer and IT Instructor currently specializing in **AWS Cloud Architecture**. My work focuses on designing **secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions**. With a strong foundation in **Computer Science**, I am passionate about building resilient architectures and integrating **security from day one**.

This blog serves as my **digital brain dump**: lessons learned, architectural patterns, project breakdowns, and the occasional “why won’t this work?” moment, shared openly as I build.
