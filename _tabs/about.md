## Hi, My name is Abdullah Bello.  
An **IT Instructor** and an aspiring **Cloud Security Engineer**  

Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I am currently enrolled into the **AWS Cloud** programme with **ALX AFRICA**, gaining hands-on experience in designing **secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud solutions**. With a background in **Computer Science**, I am passionate about building resilient architectures and integrating **security from day one**.

This blog is my **digital brain dump**: lessons learned, architectural patterns, project breakdowns, and the occasional “why won’t this work?” moment, shared openly as I grow.
