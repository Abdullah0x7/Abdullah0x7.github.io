Are you curious about cloud computing but not sure where to begin? You’re not alone. I recently started my journey by preparing for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** exam, and I’ve written this guide to help you get started too, even if you're completely new.

In this post, I’ll break down the basics in plain English, walk you through the evolution of computing, and explain what makes **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** a big deal. If you're considering a future in tech, this is a great place to begin.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Imagine you want to store photos or run a website. You could:

* Buy a big computer
* Keep it running 24/7
* Pay for electricity and maintenance

Or…

You could just rent space and power from a company like **AWS**, and only pay for what you use.

**Cloud computing** is simply using **remote servers over the internet** instead of your own laptop or office server. It’s like using Google Drive instead of a USB flash drive.

## Why Did We Move to the Cloud?

Let’s look at how computing has evolved:

### 1. Dedicated Servers

One computer for one person or company.
- ✅ Private and secure
- ❌ Expensive, hard to maintain

### 2. Virtual Machines (VMs)

One computer runs several virtual computers.
- ✅ Cheaper, better use of resources
- ❌ Still hard to scale

### 3. Containers

Small, lightweight environments for apps
- ✅ Fast, flexible
- ❌ Needs some tech knowledge

### 4. Serverless (Functions)

Just write your code, AWS runs it for you.
- ✅ Super cheap, no server setup
- ❌ Slight delay when starting up (cold start)

## Types of Cloud Services (The Big 3)

Different people use the cloud differently. Here's how:

| Type                                     | Who Uses It   | Example        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **SaaS** *(Software as a Service)*       | Regular users | Gmail, Netflix |
| **PaaS** *(Platform as a Service)*       | Developers    | Heroku         |
| **IaaS** *(Infrastructure as a Service)* | IT/Admins     | AWS EC2, Azure |

---

## What is AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the world’s most popular **cloud service provider**.

They offer over **200+ tools** to help you:

* Store files
* Run websites
* Build apps
* Use AI
* And more!

They started with:

* SQS in 2004 (messaging)
* S3 in 2006 (storage)
* EC2 in 2006 (virtual machines)

## Types of Cloud Setup (Deployment Models)

Not every company uses the cloud the same way.
