So here’s a fun story.

> As part of my ongoing cloud security training with CloudSec Network, I was given a practical task:

> “Launch a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance on AWS and connect to it remotely via RDP", but I'm on Linux

> It sounded straightforward... but it turned into a valuable learning experience that made me appreciate the little details in secure cloud configurations.

Let me walk you through exactly what I did, what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently next time.

### Step 1: Launching the Instance

I headed over to the AWS Console and launched a **Windows Server 2019 Base** instance. Nothing fancy, I went with the free-tier option (t2.micro) and downloaded the .pem key, I’d need it later to decrypt the Windows admin password.

---

### Step 2: Setting Up Security (This Is Important!)

Here’s where I paused:

> “Do I really want the world RDP’ing into this thing?”

Of course not.

So instead of opening RDP (port 3389) to the world (`0.0.0.0/0`), I added a **custom rule** to allow access **only from my public IP**.

That way, only I could connect. Secure and simple.

### Step 3: Decrypting the Admin Password

After a few minutes (because Windows takes time to boot and generate credentials), I:

1. Clicked **Connect > RDP Client**
2. Uploaded my `.pem` file
3. Decrypted the password

Got my `Administrator` password. So far, so good.

### Step 4: Connecting from Linux (Let the Fun Begin)

Here’s the fun part, I’m on **Linux**. No Remote Desktop Connection here.
So I installed **Remmina**, a great RDP client:

```bash
sudo apt install remmina -y
```

Then I tried to connect using the **public IP address** of the EC2 instance.

Nothing.

Tried again. Same error.

Then it hit me:

> “What if I use the **Public DNS** instead of the IP?”

Boom, it worked.

I was in 🎉

### What I Learned

* AWS makes cross-platform cloud ops totally doable
* Remmina works great for remote Windows access
* The **Public DNS** is more reliable than the IP in some cases
* Always restrict access to **your IP**, don’t expose RDP to the world

### Final Thoughts

As someone diving deeper into cloud and infrastructure, moments like this, where theory meets practice, really cement the learning. If you're a Linux user working with AWS Windows environments, Remmina is your friend.
