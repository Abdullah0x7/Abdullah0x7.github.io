There was a time when books used to be the primary source of information, but today we've found ourselves bombarded with an overwhelming amount of it from a multitude of sources. I've always been obsessed with information, as far back as 2016, after my secondary school education. I remember creating a blog with the blogspot.com domain to share university admission information and gist while I was actively looking for admission myself. I called it **ngcampusinfo.blogspot.com**. I eventually shut this blog down.

I even owned a channel on WhatsApp (it was called Campus Connect), where I also shared admission information and campus gist, which I later rebranded into sharing news updates, trending gist, and funny content. 

But back then, I never really thought about whether everything I was sharing was accurate or not, it was more about what was _hot_. Looking back, I realize how easy it is to pass on misinformation without even meaning to.

One thing I've always done is ask _why_. I remember my mum complaining about how I always found any small opportunity to throw the question: _Why is this thing like this? Why should I do this? Why do I have to get this done?_ I was just interested in information. I enjoy knowing things.

This habit of asking _why_ is something I still do to this day, some of my colleagues always wonder: _How did you know this? When did you learn about this?_

The truth is, for years I just wanted to know _more_, but not necessarily _better_. I didn’t realize how easy it is to mistake noise for knowledge.

And honestly, the answer lies in something I only recently discovered the proper name for while taking a Coursera course: **information literacy**.

### So, what exactly is **Information Literacy**?


> Simply put, **information literacy** is a set of skills that help you navigate information overload.

It's what allows you to:

- Tell the difference between a credible article and clickbait.
    
- Ask the right questions (like _why is this thing like this?_) before accepting what you hear or read.
    
- Know when you're being informed, and when you're being influenced.

###  6 Key Concepts That Make Up Information Literacy:

1. **Authority is constructed and contextual**  
    Not every source deserves your trust. You learn to question _who_ is providing the information, _why_, and _what makes them credible_ in that specific context. What works for health advice may not apply to tech news, context matters.
    
2. **Information creation is a process**  
    Every piece of information goes through a journey, from research and writing to revision and sharing. Understanding this helps you spot incomplete or rushed info. Not everything you see online is the final truth.
    
3. **Information has value**  
    Beyond just learning, information is a commodity. It drives decisions, forms opinions, sells products, and shapes minds. That tweet, that blog post, that news article, they all carry _value_, and sometimes an _agenda_.
    
4. **Research as inquiry**  
    Information literacy thrives on curiosity. It's all about digging deeper, asking the tough questions, testing ideas, and not stopping at the first Google result. This is where my “asking why” habit fits perfectly.
    
5. **Scholarship as conversation**  
    Information isn’t created in a vacuum. It’s part of an ongoing conversation. Whether it’s in academia, on forums, or in group chats, we’re all bouncing ideas off one another. You contribute by understanding different perspectives and citing your sources.
    
6. **Searching as a strategic exploration**  
    Google isn’t magic. Knowing how to search, what keywords to use, which filters to apply, and which sources to trust, is an underrated superpower. With good strategy, you get better results and save time.

### Fake News:

When evaluating if a piece of content is credible, ask:

- **Where** did this article come from?
    
- **Who** wrote it, and are they qualified or biased?
    
- **Why** was it written, to inform, persuade, or go viral?

Today, loving information isn’t enough. I’ve learned to question it, trace it, and treat it with the same care we give to anything powerful, because it _is_ powerful.

Information can build or mislead, teach or deceive. Learning to navigate it isn’t just a skill, it’s survival.
